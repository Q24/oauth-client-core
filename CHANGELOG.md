Initial release of the new oauth package. This is the evolved variant of https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hawaii-framework/oidc-implicit-core which will be deprecated somewhere soon.
This package is more in line with the OpenID Connect specs in many places, and supports both Code Flow (With PKCE) and Implicit Flow.
